## What Is a Bit?

A **bit** (binary digit) is the most basic unit of data in computing. It represents one of two possible states:

- `1` (on)

- `0` (off)

These states can correspond to voltage levels (e.g., 5V = 1, 0V = 0) in hardware.

## Analogue vs Digital Signals

- **Analogue Signals**: Infinitely granular and continuous, e.g., sound waves.

- **Digital Signals**: Finite, binary values (1s and 0s). Easier to store, process, and transmit.

## Data Flow 

The flow of data from an application to transmission occurs in layers:

- **TDU** → **Segments** → **Datagrams** → **Packets** → **Frames** → **Bits**
