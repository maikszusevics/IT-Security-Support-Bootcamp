DNS servers - map domain names to IP addresses.
You typically can't get to a website without DNS (unless you know and enter the IP address directly).
Whenever you visit a site by its domain name, your device queries a DNS server.
The DNS server returns the corresponding IP address to your browser.
Your browser then connects to that IP address, requests the webpage, and displays the content.


dynamic IP - changes, automatic
static IP - doesnt change


DHCP - assigns ip addresses to whoever needs it
leases IP addresses
IP addresses have a lifetime - a lease time 
it has a start time and an end time 

only time you dont use a DHCP/ use a static IP is when its for a shared device, like a printer, or a server.
