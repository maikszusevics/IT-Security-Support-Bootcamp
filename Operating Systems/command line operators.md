#### IPCONFIG
IP addresss - unique identifier 
made up of 4 byunch of numbers 
seperated by a full stop eg 192.168.0.226

IP address + subnet mask = Unique ID (host ID + network ID) 
IP address is your house number 
Subnet mask is like a postcode
Default gateway is the front door of your house AKA router 
Routers sit on the edge of your network 
WAN and LAN 
Wide Area Network (public)
Local Area Network (private)
Routers connect networks 
Switches connect devices 
If router fails you cannot get out to the internet
