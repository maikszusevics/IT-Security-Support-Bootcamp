# Vendor Support Documentation

If you purchase a product or subscription from Microsoft, Google, Amazon or Apple they will provide support for that product/service for an agreed length of time. 
Vendor support documentation facilitates agreements, expectations, terms and conditions, and intellectual property between the parties involved.

Vendor support documentation includes SLAs, OLAs, NDAs, and T&Cs. These are formal agreements that define how support is provided between service providers and customers or between internal teams.



## Managed Service Provider (MSP)

An MSP is a company that manages IT services for other businesses.

For example, If a small business doesn't have its own IT team, they might hire an MSP to handle things like setting up devices and servers, keeping software up to date, protecting against cyber threats, and solving technical issues with software and hardware.

Strong vendor support documentation enables MSPs to maintain higher service levels with fewer internal resources, directly affecting profitability and scalability. 


## SLA - Service Level Agreement

An SLA is a formal, customer-facing contract between a service provider and a client. It defines the expected level of service, how performance is measured, and what penalties apply if standards aren't met.

Key elements in an SLA:
- Service uptime guarantees
- Quality of service (QoS)
- Scope of services provided
- Response and resolution times
- Start/end dates of the agreement
- Parties involved
- Penalties for non-compliance

### Response Times
Response time refers to how long it takes from when a support request is made to when a technician begins working on the issue.

- Larger organisations may have slower internal response times.
- MSPs usually have help desks ready to assist quickly via remote or on-site support.
- Most issues are resolved remotely.

### SLA Penalties
SLA breaches are evaluated based on:
- **Severity** - Impact on business, customers, and reputation.
- **Frequency** - Repeated issues may indicate poor service.

**Examples:**
- *Minor delay*: Late software update = 10% refund per day + 1-month free extension.
- *Major outage*: Failing 99.9% uptime = compensation for lost revenue.
- *Security breach*: Data exposure = right to compensation and potential contract termination.



## OLA - Operational Level Agreement

An OLA is an internal agreement, between the company and its staff. It outlines performance targets like:

- Response and resolution times for internal tickets
- On-prem server availability

OLAs are used to set internal expectations and track service delivery using KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). While not legally binding, they influence employee performance reviews or bonuses.



## NDA - Non-Disclosure Agreement

An NDA is a legally binding agreement that ensures sensitive or confidential information is not disclosed to unauthorised parties.

- Also known as a confidentiality agreement.
- Common during business negotiations or employment.
- Protects intellectual property, trade secrets, and strategic plans.



## T&Cs - Terms and Conditions

T&Cs define the rules users must follow when using a service or product. It's a legal agreement between a provider and user.

Also known as:
- Terms of Use / Terms of Service (ToS)
- End-User License Agreement (EULA)
- General Conditions / Legal Notes

**Examples of T&Cs content:**
- Copyright and content usage rights
- User behavior guidelines
- Account suspension or cancellation policies

## Policies

Policies are documents which establish the rules of conduct within an organisation, outlining the responsibilities of both employees and employers. Company policies and procedures are in place to protect the rights of workers as well as business interests.

A policy refers to an individual set of rules/conduct for an intended purpose.

**Examples:**
- **Acceptable Use Policy** (AUP)
	- Document stipulating constraints and practises that a user must agree to for access to a corporate network or use of a company asset.
	- Purpose - why the policy exists.
	- Scope - who is affected by the policy.
	- Unacceptable use - non exhaustive list of unacceptable behaviours providing clear examples.
	- Consequences of Breach - Penalties imposed by the organisation for breach of policy. For example, verbal warning, dismissal, fine, etc...
- **Security Policy**
	- There to protect the companies IT assets, employees, and data.
	- Security policies are live documents that are continuously updated and reviewed as technologies, vulnerabilities, and security requirements change.
	- May describe how the company plans to educate it's employees about protecting the company's assets.
- **Password Policy**
	- Password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly.
	- Often digitally enforced by credential management systems implemented across organisational networks.
	- A robust password policy will consider the following characteristics:
		- Password History
		- Password Age
		- Password Length
		- Password Complexity Requirements

- **BYOD Policy** 
	- Bring Your Own Device policy makes staff aware of the issues caused by using personal devices for work and sets down the key steps to be followed in limiting the potential risks to employers.

- **Multi Factor Authentication Policy (MFA)**
	- When MFA is enabled, users access systems by presenting proof of at least two factors or more for authentication.
    
		- **Knowledge** - Something they know (such as a password).
		- **Possession** - Something they have (such as a device).
		- **Inherence** - Something they are (biometrics, like a fingerprint or iris scan).
    
	- This extra layer of security means systems are far less likely to be attacked, and data is much more secure.
	- An MFA policy can be configured to make it mandatory for this process to be followed by users.

Policies help ensure **compliance**, **consistency**, and **accountability** in IT environments.

### SOP - Standard Operating Procedure

A detailed, written set of instructions outlining the steps for performing a specific task or routine activity. SOPs are designed to ensure consistency, efficiency, and quality in how tasks are executed. 


## Five Nines - High Availability (99.999%)

"Five Nines" (99.999%) uptime represents approximately 5 minutes of downtime per year, the gold standard for system reliability.

**Applications:**
- Necessary for mission-critical systems in healthcare, financial services, and enterprise cloud platforms.
- Targeted by premium cloud providers and communications services.

**Implementation considerations:**
- Requires redundant infrastructure, automated failover systems, and 24/7 monitoring.
- Demands rigorous testing, proactive maintenance, and rapid incident response capabilities.

**Reliability context:**
- 99.999% uptime: ~5 minutes downtime/year
- 99.9% uptime: ~8.8 hours downtime/year
- 99% uptime: ~3.65 days downtime/year
- 90% uptime: ~36.5 days downtime/year


## Intellectual Property (IP)

IP documents prove legal ownership of intangible assets like inventions, designs, logos, and creative works.

#### Most common forms of IP documents:

**Trademark License:**
- Grants permission to use a protected brand name, logo, or slogan.
- Typically includes usage guidelines, quality control provisions, and territory limitations.
- Protects brand identity and consumer recognition in the market.

**Patent Certificate:**
- Official document issued by a government patent office confirming exclusive rights to an invention.
- Provides legal protection against others making, using, or selling the patented invention.
- Usually valid for 20 years from filing date, requiring maintenance fees to remain active.

**Copyright License:**
- Grants permission to use, reproduce, distribute, or display creative works (text, software, music, etc.).
- Can be exclusive or non-exclusive, with specific usage rights and duration defined.
- Protects original expression of ideas rather than the ideas themselves.
