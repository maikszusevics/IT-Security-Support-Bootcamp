# IT Security & Support Bootcamp Documentation

This repository contains detailed documentation, study notes, and personal reflections created during my participation in the 12-week **IT Security & Support Bootcamp (WMCA, April–July 2025)**.

It serves as both a learning archive and a practical portfolio of my technical growth in IT support, networking, cybersecurity, and professional development.
