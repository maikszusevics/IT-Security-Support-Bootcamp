# IT Security & Support Bootcamp Documentation

This repository contains documentation of my participation in the 12-week IT Security & Support Bootcamp with Althaus Ditigtal.

It serves as both a personal archive of my learning and a living portfolio of my technical growth in IT support, networking, and cybersecurity.

## Contents

### Core Bootcamp Modules

The bootcamp is organised into folders based on focus areas. Each folder contains Markdown files which are organised and formatted versions of my study notes. They aim to break down key concepts, tools, and methods covered in live sessions and on-demand content.

- `Operating Systems/` - Introduction to operating systems and system fundamentals  
- `Customer Support/` - Stakeholder communication, virtual teams, and customer-facing skills  
- `Service Desk and Troubleshooting/` - Ticketing systems, vendor documentation, and troubleshooting  
- `Infrastructure/` - Hardware, software, virtualisation, and cloud computing  
- `Networking/` - TCP/IP, OSI model, network configuration, and security  
- `Cybersecurity/` - Threats, controls, awareness, and frameworks   
- `Learning/` - Pluralsight, W3Schools, Netacad, etc.


## Purpose

This repository is not only a record of learning but also a **portfolio of evidence** designed to support consistent professional development and to enhance my employability in IT roles. It reflects independent initiative, technical comprehension, and a commitment to practical growth.


## Notes

- All documentation is written in Markdown for clarity and compatibility.
- This repository will be updated regularly as the bootcamp progresses.
