# IT Security & Support Bootcamp Documentation

This repository contains documentation of my participation in the 12-week IT Security & Support Bootcamp with Althaus Ditigtal.

It serves as both a personal archive of my learning and a living portfolio of my technical growth in IT support, networking, and cybersecurity.

## Contents

### Core Bootcamp Modules

The bootcamp is organised into folders based focus areas. Each folder contains Markdown files which are organised and formatted versions of my study notes. They aim to break down key concepts, tools, and methods covered in live sessions and on-demand content.

- `Operating Systems/` – Introduction to operating systems and system fundamentals  
- `Customer Support/` – Stakeholder communication, virtual teams, and customer-facing skills  
- `Service Desk and Troubleshooting/` – Ticketing systems, vendor documentation, and troubleshooting  
- `Infrastructure Basics/` – Hardware, software, virtualisation, and cloud computing  
- `Networking Basics/` – TCP/IP, OSI model, network configuration, and security  
- `Cybersecurity Fundamentals/` – Threats, controls, awareness, and frameworks  
- `Risk and Compliance/` – BCP, DRP, IR, risk management, and legal standards  
- `Careers and Development/` – CV workshops, job readiness, and trainer modules  
- `Soft Skills/` – Emotional intelligence, productivity, conflict handling, and feedback  

### Learning (On-Demand Content, Personal Troubleshooting Knowledge Base)

The `Learning/` directory documents my learning outside the live bootcamp sessions on Zoom, focusing on technical skills, troubleshooting documentation practise, and overall IT knowledge.


## Purpose

This repository is not only a record of learning but also a **portfolio of evidence** designed to support consistent professional development and to enhance my employability in IT roles. It reflects independent initiative, technical comprehension, and a commitment to practical growth.


## Notes

- All documentation is written in Markdown for clarity and compatibility.
- This repository will be updated regularly as the bootcamp progresses.
