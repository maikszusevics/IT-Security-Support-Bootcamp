# Wireless Telegraphy Act

#### Origins

The Wireless Telegraphy Act in the UK came about in response to the rapid growth of wireless communication technology around the turn of the 20th century. As the use of electromagnetic waves for sending messages became more widespread, especially for commercial and government purposes, the UK government saw the need to regulate the emerging medium. To ensure national security and manage the airwaves in an orderly way, the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904 was introduced, making it illegal to install or operate wireless equipment without a licence from the Postmaster General. This was followed by further legislation, such as the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1910 and the Merchant Shipping (Wireless Telegraphy) Act 1919, which helped to refine and expand the regulatory framework as the technology evolved.

#### What the Law States

The current legal framework is principally set out in the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, which consolidates previous legislation. The Act defines wireless telegraphy as "the sending of electromagnetic energy over paths not provided by a material substance" and grants the communications regulator, Ofcom, authority over the electromagnetic spectrum in the UK. 

Under the Act, it is generally unlawful to install or use any equipment for wireless telegraphy unless in accordance with a licence granted by Ofcom. It is important to note that some equipment is specifically exempted by regulations. The Act also empowers Ofcom to set licence conditions, prescribe fees (including incentive pricing to promote efficient spectrum use), and regulate technical standards. The law applies to a wide range of radio equipment, from broadcast transmitters to mobile networks and personal radio devices.

**Offences and Enforcement**

Offences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act include:

- Using radio equipment without a licence or outside the terms of an exemption.
- Operating equipment in breach of licence conditions.
- Knowingly or recklessly providing false information to Ofcom.
- Deliberate interference with radio equipment, such as using jammers.
- Unauthorised interception or disclosure of wireless messages.

Enforcement is managed by Ofcom, which has a range of powers:

- Issuing Contravention Notices to those suspected of breaches, allowing a period for compliance.
- Issuing written warnings or Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) for certain offences, with a standard penalty of Â£100[.
- Pursuing criminal prosecution for serious or repeated breaches, including illegal broadcasting and unauthorised use of repeaters.
- Imposing fines, which can reach up to level 3 on the standard scale for certain offences.

**Impact on Industry**

By setting up a clear licensing system, the Wireless Telegraphy Act has helped wireless technology grow in a controlled and organised way. Ofcom now manages the airwaves, making sure the EM spectrum is used efficiently, keeping interference low, and encouraging competition and innovation. With incentive pricing in place, organisations are pushed to make better use of the spectrum, helping drive new tech forward.

As of 2025, the Wireless Telegraphy Act remains a cornerstone of UK telecommunications law, continuously updated to address technological advances and the evolving needs of the sector.
