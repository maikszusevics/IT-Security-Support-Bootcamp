# Computer Misuse Act

The **Computer Misuse Act** is a fundamental piece of legislation in the UK, specifically designed to criminalise unauthorised access to, and actions that compromise, computer systems. Its main goal is to **deter individuals from using computers for illegal purposes**.

#### Origins

This Act was introduced in **1990** as a direct consequence of a notable case involving hackers named **Schifreen and Gold**. These individuals managed to gain unauthorised access to the Duke of Edinburgh's mail. At the time of this incident, there was no existing law that allowed for their prosecution, which highlighted a significant gap in the legal framework regarding computer-related offences.

#### What the Law States

The Computer Misuse Act clearly defines **three core offences** relating to the misuse of computers and data:

- It is **illegal to access data stored unless you have permission**.
- It is **illegal to access data when that material will be used to commit further illegal acts**.
- It is **illegal to change data stored without permission**.

#### Offences and Enforcement

For a successful prosecution under the Computer Misuse Act, **intent must be proven**. This means it needs to be demonstrated that the person deliberately planned or intended to carry out the unauthorised action.

It is crucial to understand that not all illegal digital activities fall under this Act. For example, activities like pirating are **not covered** by the Computer Misuse Act; instead, they are addressed under **Intellectual Property (IP) law**.

#### Impact on Industry

The Computer Misuse Act is widely regarded as a **key component of the UK's online safety legislation**. It operates in conjunction with other significant laws, such as the **Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018** and the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. Together, these regulations govern the collection, processing, and storage of personal data, and they mandate secure processing practices.

These laws are part of a broader framework known as **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)**. GRC ensures that organisations adhere to relevant laws, regulations, standards, and their own internal policies. Failing to comply with these regulations can lead to serious consequences, including legal penalties, damage to reputation, or significant financial losses for businesses.
