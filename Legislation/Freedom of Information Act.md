# Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) - Documentation

## Overview

The **Freedom of Information Act 2000 (FOIA)** is a UK law that gives the public the right to access information held by public authorities. It was designed to increase transparency and accountability in government and other public organisations.

---

## Origins and Background

- **Introduced:** Passed in the year 2000, came into full effect on **1 January 2005**.
- **Reason:** Part of wider reforms aimed at making the UK government more open and accountable, especially after years of secrecy around government activity.
- **Context:** The UK was relatively late to adopt freedom of information laws compared to countries like Sweden (1766) and the United States (1966).

## What the Act Does

The FOIA gives **any person** (regardless of nationality or location) the right to:

- **Request recorded information** held by public authorities.
- Be **informed whether the information exists**.
- Receive the information **within 20 working days**, unless exemptions apply.

### Applies To:

- Government departments  
- Local authorities  
- NHS bodies  
- Schools, colleges, and universities  
- Police forces  
- Publicly owned companies  
- Some private companies performing public functions

---

## Key Principles

1. **Transparency:** Public bodies must be open about what they do and how they do it.
2. **Accountability:** Individuals can scrutinise decisions, spending, and operations.
3. **Openness by Default:** Information should be disclosed unless there is a good reason not to.

---

## Exemptions

There are **23 exemptions**, split into two main types:

- **Absolute exemptions:** e.g., information accessible by other means, court records, security matters.
- **Qualified exemptions:** e.g., commercial interests, policy formulation, these require a **public interest test**.

---

## Offences and Non-Compliance

### Offences under the FOIA:

- **Section 77 Offence:** Knowingly altering, deleting, or concealing information that has been requested.
  - **Penalty:** Fine up to **£5,000** in a Magistrates' Court, or **unlimited** if prosecuted in a Crown Court.

### Other forms of non-compliance:

- **Failing to respond** to requests within the statutory timeframe.
- **Providing incomplete or misleading information**.
- **Refusing requests without valid exemptions**.

These may not always be criminal offences but can result in enforcement actions.

---

## Enforcement and Oversight

### Regulator:
The **Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)** oversees and enforces FOIA compliance.

### Powers of the ICO:

- Investigate complaints.
- Issue **decision notices** (binding rulings).
- Issue **enforcement notices** for systemic non-compliance.
- Impose fines and penalties (especially for deliberate obstruction or destruction of data).

---

## Why It Matters in IT and Security Roles

- **Data Handling:** IT professionals must know which information is subject to FOIA and how to securely store, retrieve, or redact it when necessary.
- **Retention Policies:** IT must ensure that data is not deleted prematurely, especially when it could be the subject of a request.
- **Access Control:** Sensitive or exempt information must be properly managed so that only authorised personnel can access or disclose it.
- **Incident Response:** If data is destroyed or tampered with after an FOI request, this can constitute a criminal offence traceability and logs are key.

---

## Summary

The FOIA is a cornerstone of public sector transparency. For IT professionals, especially those working with government or public data, it’s critical to:

- Understand the rights it grants.
- Know what data may be requested.
- Ensure systems are compliant and auditable.
- Handle requests appropriately and lawfully.
