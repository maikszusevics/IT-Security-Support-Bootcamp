# Official Secrets Act

#### Origins

The Official Secrets Act has its roots in the late nineteenth century, introduced in response to concerns over the unauthorised disclosure of government information and espionage. The first Act, passed in 1889, was designed to address breaches of official trust following several incidents where sensitive information was leaked from government departments. The legislation was significantly strengthened in 1911, during a period of heightened anxiety about foreign espionage, particularly amid fears of German spying before the First World War. The 1911 Act was rushed through Parliament, reflecting the urgency of national security concerns at the time. Over the years, the Act was amended and expanded, notably in 1920, 1939, and most recently in 1989, to address evolving security challenges and clarify the scope of protected information.

#### What the Law States

The Official Secrets Act is a series of laws that protect official information, particularly in relation to national security, defence, and international relations. The 1911 Act established offences related to espionage, sabotage, and the unauthorised handling of official information. Section 1 targets espionage and activities prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, while Section 2 (now replaced) previously made it an offence to disclose any official information without authority.

The Official Secrets Act 1989 replaced Section 2 of the 1911 Act. Under the 1989 Act, it is an offence for Crown servants, government contractors, and others with access to official information to make unauthorised disclosures in six specified categories, but only if the disclosure is considered damaging to the national interest. The six categories are:

- Security and intelligence
- Defence
- International relations
- Crime and special investigation powers
- Information resulting from unauthorised disclosures
- Information entrusted in confidence to the UK by other states or international organisations

The Act applies to current and former Crown servants, government contractors, and, in some cases, members of the public who come into possession of official information.

#### Offences and Enforcement

Offences under the Official Secrets Act include espionage, unauthorised disclosure of protected information, and actions likely to prejudice the safety or interests of the state. For members or former members of the security and intelligence services, any unauthorised disclosure relating to security or intelligence is an offence. For other Crown servants and contractors, the disclosure must be shown to be damaging within the specified categories.

Enforcement is carried out by the police and prosecuting authorities. The maximum penalty for unauthorised disclosure under the 1989 Act is two years’ imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. For espionage and related offences under the 1911 Act, penalties can be more severe. Prosecutions require the consent of the Attorney General, ensuring oversight in the application of the law.

#### Impact on Industry

The Official Secrets Act has influenced the IT industry by placing legal obligations on individuals and organisations handling sensitive government or defence-related data. It’s especially relevant for IT professionals working in public sector roles, defence contracting, or companies handling classified information. The Act makes it a criminal offence to disclose certain types of information without authorisation, which means strict security protocols, access controls, and data handling procedures must be in place. It has also shaped hiring practices, with background checks and security clearances often required for roles involving classified systems or networks. Overall, the Act reinforces the importance of confidentiality and data protection across both public and private sector IT operations.
