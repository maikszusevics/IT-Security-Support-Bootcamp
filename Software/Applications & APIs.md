# Application Types

Software applications can be categorised by platform and purpose:

### By Platform

- **Desktop Applications** – Installed directly on a user's computer (e.g., Microsoft Word, Photoshop).
- **Mobile Applications** – Designed for smartphones or tablets, typically installed via app stores (e.g., WhatsApp, Spotify).
- **Web Applications** – Accessed through a browser; rely on technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (e.g., Google Docs, Trello).

### By Function

- **Productivity Applications** – Tools that help users complete tasks (e.g., Microsoft Office, Notion).
- **Entertainment Applications** – Games, media players, and streaming platforms (e.g., Steam, Netflix).
- **Communication Applications** – Enable messaging and collaboration (e.g., Zoom, Slack).
- **Utility Applications** – Support system maintenance or performance (e.g., antivirus, file managers).
# APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

APIs allow software components to **communicate, share data, and delegate functionality**.

### Common Types of APIs


- **Web APIs** - Use web protocols (HTTP/S) for communication.
- **Library APIs** – Provide a set of callable functions with documentation, can operate in offline environments. 
- **Operating System APIs** – Allow applications to interface with the OS. 
- **Hardware APIs** – Allow apps to interact with physical components (GPU, camera)
