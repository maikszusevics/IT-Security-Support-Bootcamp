# Programming and Markup Languages

High level programming languages can be learned by humans because it is human readable.

Low level programming languages are made to be understood by machines. They are a step above binary.

Software written in high level programming languages needs to be translated for the processor to be able to ready it.

Compilers and Interpreters do the translation of high level programming languages into low level programming languages (in binary)

### Programming Concepts

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – A programming paradigm based on objects that contain data and behaviour. Key principles include:
    - **Encapsulation** – Bundling data with methods.
    - **Inheritance** – Deriving new classes from existing ones.
    - **Polymorphism** – Methods behaving differently based on context.
    - Languages: Python, Java, C#, C++.

- **Common Functions in Programming**
    - `if/else` – Conditional logic
    - `while` loop – Repeats code while a condition is true
    - `for` loop – Iterates over sequences
    - `do...while` loop – Runs at least once before checking the condition

### Markup Languages

Markup languages use special symbols (tags) to tell computers how to display or structure text, like making words bold or creating headings. Examples include HTML for websites and Markdown for simple formatting, both helping turn plain text into organised, visually formatted content.

- **HTML** – Structures content on the web.
- **XML** – Used for data storage and transport with strict formatting.
- **Markdown (MD)** – Lightweight syntax for formatting text.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a **high-level scripting language** widely used in web development for:

- Real-time content manipulation
- Interactive user interfaces
- Communicating with APIs (e.g., via `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`)
- Server-side development (Node.js)
- Mobile and desktop app development via frameworks (React Native, Electron)

### PHP

A server-side scripting language used for building dynamic web applications.

- Commonly embedded in HTML.
- Powers platforms like WordPress and content management systems.

### Compiled vs Interpreted Languages

Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code.
- They tend to be faster and more efficient 
- More control over hardware aspects 
- C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, Go

Interpreted languages run through a program line by line.

- Interpreted languages were once significantly slower than compiled languages. Today the gap is much closer.
- Examples of common interpreted languages are PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript


## Website Development – House Analogy

Think of a website like a house:

|Component|Purpose|Analogy|
|---|---|---|
|**HTML**|Structure|The house's framework and walls|
|**CSS**|Appearance|The interior/exterior design|
|**JavaScript**|Interactivity|The moving parts – doors, switches, etc.|

- **Client-side technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – run in the user's browser.
- **Server-side technologies**: PHP, Node.js, Python – run on a web server.
