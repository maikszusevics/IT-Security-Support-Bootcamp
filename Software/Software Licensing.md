# Software Licensing

## Introduction

Software licensing defines the legal terms for using, modifying, and distributing software. Understanding licensing is essential for both software creators and users to ensure legal compliance and protect intellectual property rights.

### Common License Types

Licenses can generally be grouped under two categories, open source and proprietary or closed source.

#### Open Source Licenses

- **MIT License**: Highly permissive, allows commercial use, modification, distribution, and private use with minimal restrictions.
- **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: Requires derivative works to be distributed under the same license terms (copyleft).
- **Apache License 2.0**: Permits commercial use and modification while providing patent protection.
- **BSD Licenses**: Family of permissive licenses with varying attribution requirements.

#### Proprietary Licenses

- **Commercial Software**: Typically requires payment and restricts copying, modification, and redistribution.
- **Subscription-based**: Grants usage rights for a specific time period with recurring payments.
- **Enterprise Licensing**: Customised agreements for organisational use with volume pricing.

### Key License Components

#### Rights Granted

- Installation and usage permissions
- Modification and derivative work rights
- Distribution and sublicensing allowances
- Commercial use permissions

#### Restrictions

- Attribution requirements
- Share-alike/copyleft provisions
- Warranty disclaimers
- Liability limitations

### Compliance Considerations

#### For Software Users

1. Read license terms before installing or using software.
2. Track licenses for all software in use.
3. Comply with attribution requirements.
4. Understand redistribution limitations.

#### For Software Developers

1. Choose appropriate licenses for your projects.
2. Document third-party components and their licenses.
3. Maintain license compatibility when combining code.
4. Include proper license notices in your code.

#### License Management Best Practices

- Maintain a software inventory with license details.
- Implement a license review process for new software.
- Conduct regular compliance audits.
- Document license obligations and fulfilment.

#### Common Licensing Pitfalls

- Assuming all open source software can be used without restrictions.
- Mixing incompatible licenses in a single project.
- Failing to include required license notices.
- Misunderstanding the scope of granted rights.
