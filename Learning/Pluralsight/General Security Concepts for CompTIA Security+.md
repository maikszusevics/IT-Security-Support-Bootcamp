# General Security Concepts for CompTIA Security+



## Understanding Security Controls

### Categories of security controls/access control
``
	- Technical/Operational
		- Software and IT configurations
		- Antivirus software, encryption, access control, IPS/IDS(Intrusion Prevention Systems/Intrusion Detection Systems), firewalls
	- Managerial/Administrative
		- Not a physical thing or piece of software
		- Policies, standards, processes, procedures, guidelines, risk management, account management, regulatory controls
	- Physical
		- Real-life prevention/detection systems
		- Locks, fences, CCTV, guards, mantrap etc.

#### Deterrent
Systems or signage that is designed to discourage people from doing something 
- When you access a network, you might get a message saying that it is being monitored.
- There could be signage when you enter a restricted area
	- Tells you that it is restricted
	- Alerts you to additional controls (cameras, guards etc.)

#### Preventive
Preventive control types are designed to keep someone from doing something.
- Guards
- Fencing
- Locks, windows, cabinets

#### Detective
Controls that detect activity and initiate some sort of action.
- Sound an alarm
- Send an alert
- Record the activity for later analysis
> Doesn't Prevent access but can assist in analysing and investigating.


### Physical Control Examples
- Mantrap/Access Control Vestibule
	- A set of double doors - a way to ensure only authorised access into a building.
- Bollards
	- Protect the entrance to buildings. 
- CCTV/Surveillance Cameras

### Corrective/Recovery
Type of control used to get a system back to normal 
	- Restoring from backup
	- Updating antimalware software
	- Installing updates and patches, including firmware
	- Recovery
		- Diaster recovery or HA site
		- System/data backups

### Compensating
Control that provides an alternate solution to a countermeasure that is too difficult or too expensive to implement.
- Gate/Card swipe entrance instead of guards 24/7
- Application whitelisting instead of replacing operating systems, etc

### Types of Threats
> Not all threats are created equal, and no one control type can deter/prevent everything.
> What motivates one hacker or bad actor may be completely different than another.
> Multiple layers of defence are required to properly deter/prevent breaches.

#### Script Kiddies
- Someone who is not as skilled as a professional hacker
- Might download ready made tools for hacking
- Not very sophisticated 
- Can cause just as much damage as anyone, but not motivated by the same things as other threats

#### Hacktivists
- Motivated by ideology 
- May be protesting something 
- Have a specific cause in mind
#### Organised Crime
- Can my motivated by money, control, espionage, etc.
- Typically quite sophisticated 
- Have resources at their disposal
#### Nation States/Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Backed by a specific nation 
- Designed to go after high level targets 
- Very well funded
- Have a larger agenda than the other groups
#### Insiders
- Could be an employee or ex-employee
- Motivations can vary
#### Competitors
- Want to put you out of business or slow you down 
- Trying to get an advantage on you
