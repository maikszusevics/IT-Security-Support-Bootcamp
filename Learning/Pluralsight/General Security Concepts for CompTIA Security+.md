## Understanding Security Controls

### Categories of security controls/access control
``
	- Technical/Operational
		- Software and IT configurations
		- Antivirus software, encryption, access control, IPS/IDS(Intrusion Prevention Systems/Intrusion Detection Systems), firewalls
	- Managerial/Administrative
		- Not a physical thing or piece of software
		- Policies, standards, processes, procedures, guidelines, risk management, account management, regulatory controls
	- Physical
		- Real-life prevention/detection systems
		- Locks, fences, CCTV, guards, etc.

#### Deterrent
Systems or signage that is designed to discourage people from doing something 
- When you access a network, you might get a message saying that it is being monitored.
- There could be signage when you enter a restricted area
	- Tells you that it is restricted
	- Alerts you to additional controls (cameras, guards etc.)

#### Preventive
Preventive control types are designed to keep someone from doing something.

### Types of Threats
> Not all threats are created equal, and no one control type can deter/prevent everything.
> What motivates one hacker or bad actor may be completely different than another.
> Multiple layers of defence are required to properly deter/prevent breaches.
