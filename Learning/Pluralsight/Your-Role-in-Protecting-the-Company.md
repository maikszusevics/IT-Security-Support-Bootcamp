# Protecting Yourself from Digital Identity Theft

**Attackers want one of two things:**

- Your _username and password_
- Or for you to _install their malware_.

## Phishing: The Common First Strike

**How phishing works:**

- You get an email or message that looks legitimate.
- It asks you to log in, view a document, or click a link.
- If you do, attackers steal your credentials.

Even the best defences miss a few phishing attempts. That's why _everybody's_ vigilance matters.

# Recognising Phishing: The CUTE Checklist

When you read an email or message, ask:

- **C**urious: Does it spark curiosity unnaturally?
- **U**nexpected: Were you expecting this message?
- **T**ime-pressure: Are you rushed to act quickly?
- **E**motional: Does it trigger fear, excitement, or urgency?

**If any apply, treat the message as suspicious.**

# What To Do If You Spot Phishing

- **Report it** immediately.
- **Delete it** after reporting.
- **Never click** out of curiosity.
- If you accidentally click:
    - **Close the window.**
    - **Do not enter information.**
    - If you entered your credentials, **change your password immediately** and **report it**.

Mistakes happen to everyone, catching it early is just as important as preventing it.

# Phishing Over the Phone and Text

Attackers might _call_ or _text_ you, pretending to be IT, banking services, or authorities.

**Red flags:**

- Urgency to act.
- Requests for passwords, authentication codes, or personal information.

**Golden rule:**  
No real IT staff will ask for your password or MFA code.  
If someone does, hang up or delete the message.

# Strengthening Defenses: 2FA, Least Privilege, and Recertification

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA):**

- Adds an extra step: a code, an app confirmation, a fingerprint.
- Even if your password is stolen, the attacker is locked out without the second factor.
- **Never share authentication codes.**
- **Never approve an MFA request you didn't initiate.**

**Privilege Management:**

- You are only granted access to what you need.
- This limits the damage if your account is compromised.

**User Access Updates:**

- Managers periodically review who has access to what, ensuring old or unnecessary access is revoked.

These safeguards are in place to protect you, not to burden you.

# Protecting Yourself at Home

Phishing attacks donâ€™t stop at work:

- **Common topics:** fake tax refunds, bank alerts, fines, lottery wins.
- **Follow the CUTE checklist** at home too.
- If you suspect phishing, **delete the message**.

# Password Hygiene and Password Managers

Attackers can guess passwords because humans reuse them.  
To protect yourself:

- **Use unique passwords** for every account.
- **Use a password manager** to store them securely.
- **Enable 2FA wherever possible.**

One weak password can unravel everything. Defend yourself wisely.
