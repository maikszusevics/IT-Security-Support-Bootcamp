# business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident response


## Incident Response

Outcomes of a Business Continuity Management System:
Incident response planning 
	Life Safety 
	Containment
	Documentation 
	Return to normal 
Business continuity Planning 
	BIA (business impact analysis)
	Critical Business Functions 
	Recovery Time objective 
	Data recovery Point objective 
	Requirements to enable recovery of systems 
Disaster Recovery Planning
	Relocation of IT and other services to another location 


Event - any measurable occurrence 
incident - a type of event with the potential to affect business mission 

Business Resilience:
the ability to continue operations even during adverse circumstances 

Response Planning 
	 Historical events 
	 Current threats 
	 Areas of change 

Incident management is a structured process 
	 preparation 
	 prevention 
	 detection 
	 containment
	 restoration 
	 lessons learned 

Preparation 
	 Policy 
	 Authority 
	 Team members 
	 Procedures 
	 Documentation 
	 Reporting

Prevention 
	Offense drives defence 
	monitor systems, networks, applications, and users
	Test controls 
	awareness

MANAGE THE INCIDENT DONT LET THE INCIDENT MANAGE YOU 
PREVENTION OVER RECOVERY - LEARN FROM INCIDENTS HOW TO BE BETTER PREPARED 

Detection 
	 Tools and technology 
		 Behaviour analysis
		 Signatures
		 Heuristics (Type of AI that tries to learn when something is undesirable)
	Alarms
	Audits

Incident Detection 
	Helpdesk first line 
			Trouble tickets 
				Look for patterns 
	Alerts from monitoring systems 

First priority when something goes wrong is life safety

Classification 
	Is it a real incident or just noise/false positive 
	True positive/Real incident 
		Minor
		Serious 
		Catastrophic 
	Internal or external
	Intentional or accidental 
	activation of response teams 

Containment
	Isolation 
		Fire doors 
		network connection 
		quarantine 
			sandbox
				Put malware or infected machine into a secure environment where its behaviour can be observed so that it is understood
	Power Down 
	Monitoring (for just minor incidents)

Containment considerations 
	Response depends on :
		Criticality 
		Ability to spread 
		Gathering of evidence 


Eradication 
	Removal of damage 
	rebuild
		Backups 
		patches 
	Replacement of hardware

Restoration 
	Return to normal 
	Timelines 
		Prioritisation of recovery 
	Prevent re-infection

Documentation
	Steps and procedures used in recovery
	Retain to assist in future incidents 

Reporting 
	Reporting conclusion of the incident 
		What caused the incident 
			Multiple factors / just one factor
		What was done to address and mitigate 
		Commendations for staff
		Lessons Learned
