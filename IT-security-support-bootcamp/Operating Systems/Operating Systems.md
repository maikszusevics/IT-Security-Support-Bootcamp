# Operating Systems

An **Operating System (OS)** is the foundational software layer that enables communication between a computer's hardware and the applications that run on it. It manages system resources such as the CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices, providing users with a coherent interface to interact with the system.

### IoT Operating Systems

IoT OSes are designed for embedded systems and devices with limited computing power. They often serve as programmable controllers over networks.

- Lightweight, real-time, and energy-efficient.
- Common examples: TinyOS, RIOT OS, and embedded versions of Linux.
- Act like programmable logic controllers (PLCs) with internet connectivity.
- Fuchsia is an operating system designed to be used in both mobile devices and IoT devices

## Key Components of an Operating System

### Kernel

The kernel is the foundational component of an operating system, serving as the core that controls all basic functions. It loads first during startup and remains in memory throughout system operation.

**Kernel Space vs. User Space:**

- **Kernel Space**: A protected memory area where the kernel executes with privileged access to hardware and system resources. Code running here has unrestricted access to the CPU and memory.
- **User Space**: Where regular applications run with limited privileges. Programs in user space must request kernel services through system calls when they need to access hardware or perform privileged operations.

**Types:**

- **Monolithic Kernels**: All services run in kernel space, providing direct access to resources
- **Microkernels**: Minimal functionality in kernel space, with most services in user space
- **Hybrid Kernels**: Blend both approaches for balance between performance and security

**Primary Functions:**

- **Memory Management**: Controls memory allocation for system processes and applications
- **Process Management**: Schedules and coordinates program execution
- **Device Management**: Enables I/O with hardware through device drivers
- **File System Operations**: Manages data storage and retrieval

**Security Aspects:**

- Kernel vulnerabilities are particularly serious as they can affect the entire system
- Separation between kernel space and user space provides essential security boundaries
- Kernel exploits often target breaking this separation to gain elevated privileges 

#### Notable Kernels

- **Unix Kernel**: The original kernel that established the foundation for modern operating systems.
    
- **Linux Kernel**: The most widely used open-source kernel, powers Linux distributions, Android devices, and many embedded systems.
    
- **Windows NT Kernel**: Microsoft's proprietary hybrid kernel that powers all modern Windows operating systems.
    
- **BSD Kernel**: A Unix-derived kernel that focuses on stability and security, used in FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and as the foundation for macOS.
    
- **XNU Kernel**: Apple's hybrid kernel that powers macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.
    
- **Zircon**: Google's microkernel that powers the Fuchsia operating system, designed with modern devices and security in mind.
### Drivers

Drivers are software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware peripherals (e.g., printers, keyboards, GPUs).

- Without drivers, hardware can't function correctly.
- Keeping drivers updated is essential for security and performance.

### Operating System Architecture

- **32-bit (x86[^1])**: Supports up to 4GB RAM; used in older hardware.
    
- **64-bit (x64)**: Supports large memory addressing; used in modern systems.
    
- RISC (ARM, RISC-V): Reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architecture, standard in mobile and embedded devices. Offers great power efficiency.
    
    - ARM has recently resurged in consumer computing, primarily due to Apple's M-series chips, which demonstrated that ARM-based processors can deliver exceptional performance in desktop and laptop environments while maintaining superior power efficiency compared to CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) alternatives.
        This success has influenced the market, with companies like Qualcomm developing competitive ARM chips for Windows devices (Snapdragon X Elite), and even Microsoft creating custom ARM processors. The recent industry shift represents a looming challenge to Intel and AMD's traditional traditional x86 dominance in personal computing.
        
[1]: When people contrast "x86" with "ARM" or "RISC-V" today, they're typically referring to the entire Intel/AMD architecture family (which is CISC-based) versus other RISC-based systems like ARM or RISC-V, regardless of whether they're specifically talking about 32-bit or 64-bit implementations.

## File and Folder Structures

### Windows

- Uses drive letters (e.g., C:, D:).
- Root directory usually C:.
- Common directories: Program Files, Users, Windows.

### Linux

- Root directory is "/".
- Follows a hierarchical structure.
- Common directories: /bin, /etc, /home, /var, /usr.

## User Interfaces

### GUI (Graphical User Interface)

- Visual interface using windows, icons, menus, and pointers.
- Easier for most users.
- Examples: Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, GNOME.

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

- Text-based interface.
- Offers powerful control and scripting capabilities.
- Some OSes are CLI only
	- MS-DOS (Microsoft OS before windows)
	- Early Unix versions 
	- Minimal Linux distributions
		- Alpine Linux
		- Arch Linux (base install)
- Examples: Windows CMD, PowerShell, Linux Bash.

## Operating System Hardening

Hardening is the process of securing an OS against vulnerabilities.

- Regularly update and patch.
- Remove unnecessary services and software (bloatware).
- Implement firewalls and antivirus.
- Use encryption and strong authentication.
- Kernel hardening techniques
