# Incident Response

Incident response is a crucial capability for any organisation, focusing on preparing for and managing problems and challenges that can affect business operations. It is often the initial step in addressing adverse events, and a severe incident may trigger the need for business continuity or disaster recovery plans. The primary goal is always life safety, followed by the identification and containment of the incident, and the ability to return to normal operations as swiftly as possible.

## Core Concepts

*   **Event:** Any measurable occurrence.
*   **Incident:** A type of event with the potential to adversely affect the business mission. All incidents are events, but not all events are incidents.
*   **Business Resilience:** The ability of an organisation to continue operations even during adverse circumstances.

## Outcomes of Incident Response Planning

Effective incident response planning aims to achieve:
*   Life safety of personnel.
*   Containment of the incident to prevent spread and minimise impact.
*   Thorough documentation of the incident and response.
*   A swift return to normal operations.

## Structured Process of Incident Management

Incident management follows a structured process, which includes:

### 1. Preparation
This foundational stage involves setting up the framework before an incident occurs.
*   **Policy:** Establishing clear policies on how to deal with incidents.
*   **Authority:** Defining who has the authority to make decisions during a crisis.
*   **Team Members:** Identifying and assigning roles to team members.
*   **Procedures:** Developing detailed procedures for various incident types.
*   **Documentation:** Ensuring all plans and procedures are well-documented for review and future reference.
*   **Reporting:** Establishing channels for regular reporting to management and stakeholders.
*   **Prevention over Recovery:** Learning from historical events and current threats to be better prepared and prevent future incidents.

### 2. Prevention
Focuses on reducing the likelihood and impact of incidents.
*   **Offence Drives Defence:** Understanding attacker tactics and current threats (e.g., ransomware, DDoS attacks) to inform defensive strategies.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitoring systems, networks, applications, and user activity to detect anomalies.
*   **Testing Controls:** Regularly testing security controls to ensure their effectiveness.
*   **Awareness:** Implementing awareness programmes so staff know what to watch for and how to react.

### 3. Detection
The ability to identify an incident when it happens.
*   **Tools and Technology:** Utilising tools for behavioural analysis, signature detection, heuristics (AI learning undesirable behaviour), and alarms.
*   **Audits:** Conducting audits to review past incident handling and identify areas for improvement.
*   **First Line of Defence:** The helpdesk often serves as the first point of contact for incident reports, using trouble tickets to track and look for patterns.
*   **Alerts:** Monitoring systems generate alerts for potential incidents.
*   **Prioritisation:** The first priority when something goes wrong is always life safety.

### 4. Classification
Once an occurrence is detected, it must be analysed and classified.
*   **Verification:** Determining if it is a real incident or a false positive.
*   **Severity:** Classifying true incidents as minor, serious, or catastrophic.
*   **Origin:** Identifying if it is internal or external, intentional or accidental.
*   **Team Activation:** Activating appropriate response teams based on the incident's classification.

### 5. Containment
Stopping the incident from spreading and minimising its adverse impact.
*   **Isolation:** Disconnecting infected systems from networks, closing fire doors, or quarantining systems.
*   **Sandbox:** Using secure environments (e.g., virtual machines) to observe malware behaviour without risk to other systems.
*   **Power Down:** Shutting down systems to stop malicious activity.
*   **Monitoring:** For minor incidents, continuous monitoring might be used to observe and learn from the situation without immediate shutdown.
*   **Considerations:** Response depends on criticality, ability to spread, and the need to gather evidence.

### 6. Eradication
Removing the cause of the incident and restoring affected systems.
*   **Removal of Damage:** Eliminating the compromised system or software.
*   **Rebuild:** Restoring systems from clean backups, applying necessary patches, or replacing damaged hardware (especially for persistent infections like some ransomware).
*   **Prevent Re-infection:** Taking steps to identify and address the root cause to prevent recurrence.

### 7. Restoration
Bringing operations back to normal.
*   **Timelines and Priorities:** Following predetermined timelines and prioritising the recovery of critical business functions first.
*   **Phased Recovery:** After initial recovery of critical functions, less critical business functions are restored to "normal," allowing for testing of migration plans, networks, and systems.

### 8. Documentation
Maintaining comprehensive records throughout the incident lifecycle.
*   **Procedures:** Documenting the steps and procedures used in recovery.
*   **Retention:** Retaining documentation to assist in reviewing feedback and preparing for future incidents.

### 9. Reporting
Communicating incident status and conclusions to relevant parties.
*   **Conclusion:** Reporting the conclusion of the incident.
*   **Analysis:** Documenting what caused the incident (single or multiple factors) and the actions taken to address and mitigate it.
*   **Commendations:** Acknowledging staff who performed well during the incident.
*   **Stakeholders:** Communicating with management, regulatory agencies, customers (especially for privacy breaches), suppliers, and shareholders. Regular reports are often managed from an Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).

### 10. Lessons Learned (Post-Incident Review)
The final and critical step to continuous improvement.
*   **Review:** Conducting a post-incident review (sometimes with an immediate "hot wash" and a later, more reflective "cold wash") to identify what went well and what could be improved.
*   **Competence and Leadership:** Assessing individual competence, demeanor, and leadership displayed during the crisis.
*   **Improvements:** Using lessons learned to improve preparation, plans, teams, tools, training, prevention, detection, containment, and overall awareness.
*   **Security Culture:** Fostering a security-conscious culture where all staff contribute to security and understand potential threats.

Effective incident response plans require senior management support, are detailed and action-oriented, and mandate that all team members are properly chosen, trained, and equipped. They should also link seamlessly with business continuity, disaster recovery, and human resources plans.
