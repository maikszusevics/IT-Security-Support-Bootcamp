# Disaster Recovery

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a critical component of an organisation's overall business continuity management system, specifically designed for catastrophic events. It primarily involves the relocation and rebuilding of IT and other services to an alternate, or contingency, location when the primary location has been damaged and is unusable. The goal is to recover operations at this alternate location.

## Key Elements of Disaster Recovery Planning

A comprehensive Disaster Recovery plan (DRP) focuses on several key areas:
*   **Relocation of Services**: Moving IT and other essential business services to a new site.
*   **Rebuilding Systems**: Re-establishing IT infrastructure and processes at the new location.
*   **Resource Recovery**: Ensuring the recovery of necessary data, personnel, and equipment to operate the business.

## Recovery Sites and Selection

The selection of an alternate recovery site is a crucial aspect of disaster recovery planning. The **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**, which defines the target time for restoration of a business process, is a primary driver for site selection. A faster recovery typically incurs higher costs.

Types of recovery site approaches mentioned include:
*   **Redundant Sites**: Having fully operational duplicate sites. This offers the fastest recovery but effectively doubles operational costs.
*   **Warm Site**: A less expensive option compared to redundant sites, implying a site with equipment but requiring some setup before full operation.

### Factors for Contingency Site Selection

When choosing a contingency site, several factors must be considered:
*   **Cost**: The financial implications of setting up and maintaining the site.
*   **Security**: Ensuring the new site is secure to prevent further threats.
*   **Availability**: Confirming the site will be accessible and ready when needed to meet the RTO.
*   **Proximity**: The site should be close enough for logistical purposes but far enough not to be affected by the same threat as the primary site.
*   **Logistics for Employees**: Considering how employees will travel to and work at the alternate site, especially if it's for an extended period. This includes factors like travel time and public transit availability. Managers may need to have employees and systems at different sites based on process criticality.
*   **Support**: Ensuring necessary utilities and services like power, fire, police, ambulance, and food are available at the recovery site.

## System Recovery Prioritisation

Systems recovery sequence is based on their criticality to the business. The most critical business processes should be prioritised for recovery, whether criticality is defined by financial impact or reputational impact.
