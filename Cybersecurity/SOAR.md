# Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

## Overview

**SOAR** stands for **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response**. It is a suite of tools and processes that enables security teams to streamline operations, automate incident response, and integrate with multiple security systems. SOAR platforms work in conjunction with SIEM solutions to enhance the speed and efficiency of threat detection, investigation, and remediation.

## Purpose of SOAR

- **Incident Triage**: Automates the prioritisation and categorisation of alerts.
- **Response Automation**: Executes predefined playbooks to remediate threats without human intervention.
- **Orchestration**: Connects disparate security tools and workflows into a unified response process.
- **Case Management**: Centralises incident tracking, evidence collection, and analyst collaboration.

## Key Components

| Component               | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Playbooks**           | Predefined workflows for automating specific incident response actions.       |
| **Automation Engine**   | Executes scripts or actions (e.g., block IP, isolate host) based on triggers. |
| **Orchestration Layer** | Integrates multiple security tools (e.g., SIEM, firewall, AV, ticketing).     |
| **Case Management**     | Tracks investigation details, analyst notes, and evidence.                    |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Enriches alerts with contextual data from internal and external sources.      |
| **Reporting & Metrics** | Measures response time, SLA compliance, and team performance.                 |

## Common Use Cases

1. **Automated Phishing Response**: Parse emails, extract indicators, block domains, and notify users.
2. **Suspicious Login Investigations**: Correlate login attempts with geolocation and known bad IPs.
3. **Malware Containment**: Isolate infected hosts, collect memory dumps, initiate AV scans.
4. **Ticket Automation**: Create and update service desk tickets based on alert severity and context.
5. **Threat Enrichment**: Automatically query threat intelligence feeds for IPs, hashes, and domains.

## Integration with SIEM

- **SIEM Detects → SOAR Responds**: SOAR consumes alerts from SIEM and takes automated or semi-automated action.
- **Feedback Loop**: SOAR can update SIEM correlation rules or threat scoring based on response outcomes.
- **Improved Triage**: Reduces alert fatigue by automating low-confidence or repetitive incident handling.

## Benefits

- **Reduced MTTR (Mean Time to Respond)**
- **Consistent, repeatable response workflows**
- **Lower analyst fatigue through automation**
- **Improved collaboration and knowledge retention**
- **Faster and more accurate investigations**

## Popular SOAR Platforms

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|**Cortex XSOAR**|Palo Alto’s SOAR platform, rich in playbook design and threat intel.|
|**Splunk SOAR**|Formerly Phantom, tight integration with Splunk SIEM.|
|**IBM Resilient**|Case-focused with strong incident response workflows.|
|**Swimlane**|Customisable and scalable, suitable for MSSPs.|
|**DFLabs IncMan**|Offers machine learning-assisted incident correlation.|
|**TheHive**|Open-source SOAR with integrated case management and Cortex analyzers.|

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Playbook Complexity**: Poorly designed workflows can introduce risk or fail silently.
- **Integration Effort**: Requires API compatibility and authentication with other tools.
- **Over-automation**: Automating incorrect actions can cause operational disruptions.
- **Training Requirements**: Staff must be proficient in scripting and workflow logic.

## Best Practices

- Begin with **low-risk, high-volume use cases** (e.g., phishing).
- Maintain **audit trails** for automated actions and decisions.
- Use **role-based access** to control execution of critical workflows.
- Periodically **review and refine playbooks** based on real-world incidents.
- **Test automation** in staging environments before production rollout.
- Ensure **collaboration with SOC, IR, and IT teams** during implementation.

## Summary

SOAR platforms extend the capabilities of SIEM by adding powerful automation and orchestration. They enable security operations teams to handle increasing alert volumes with greater speed, precision, and consistency. When implemented properly, SOAR acts as a force multiplier, freeing analysts to focus on complex investigations and strategic initiatives.
