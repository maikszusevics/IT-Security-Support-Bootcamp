# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

## Overview

**SIEM** stands for **Security Information and Event Management**. It is a security solution that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM tools collect, normalise, and analyse data from across an IT environment to detect and respond to potential threats.

## Purpose of SIEM

- **Centralised Logging**: Aggregates logs from various sources such as firewalls, operating systems, applications, and antivirus software.
- **Threat Detection**: Correlates events and identifies patterns that indicate possible security incidents.
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) by maintaining and reviewing security logs.
- **Incident Response**: Provides tools for investigating and managing alerts and security incidents.

## Key Components

| Component                | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Log Collection**       | Gathers log data from across the infrastructure.                       |
| **Normalisation**        | Converts log data into a common format for analysis.                   |
| **Correlation Engine**   | Identifies relationships between events to detect suspicious activity. |
| **Alerting**             | Notifies administrators of potential threats.                          |
| **Dashboards & Reports** | Visualise data for monitoring and compliance.                          |
| **Retention**            | Stores data for future analysis and audits.                            |

## Common Data Sources

- Firewalls
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Antivirus Software
- Windows Event Logs / Linux Syslogs
- Application Logs (e.g., Apache, NGINX)
- Cloud Services (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor)

## Typical Use Cases

1. **Detecting Brute-Force Attacks**
2. **Monitoring Unauthorised Access Attempts**
3. **Detecting Malware Outbreaks**
4. **Auditing User Activity**
5. **Correlating Events Across Multiple Systems**

## Benefits

- Faster incident detection and response
- Centralised visibility into security events
- Easier compliance reporting
- Proactive threat hunting capability
- Reduced dwell time of attackers

## Popular SIEM Solutions

## Challenges and Considerations

- **High Cost**: Commercial solutions can be expensive.
- **Complex Deployment**: Requires careful planning and integration.
- **False Positives**: May generate excessive or irrelevant alerts.
- **Skill Requirements**: Analysts must understand log formats, attack patterns, and correlation logic.

## Best Practices

- Define clear use cases before deployment.
- Regularly tune correlation rules to reduce false positives.
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds.
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC).
- Review and update retention policies.
- Ensure proper onboarding of all data sources.

## Summary

SIEM systems are essential tools in modern cybersecurity operations, enabling organisations to monitor, detect, and respond to threats effectively. While powerful, SIEM tools require skilled configuration, ongoing tuning, and active management to deliver value.
